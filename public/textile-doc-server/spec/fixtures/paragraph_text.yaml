      <p>According to most American sources (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style">The
      Chicago Manual of Style</a>) and to some British sources (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart%27s_Rules">The
      Oxford Guide to Style</a>), an em dash should always be set closed (not surrounded
      by spaces). But the practice in many parts of the English-speaking world,
      also the style recommended by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Manual_of_Style_and_Usage">The
      New York Times Manual of Style and Usage</a>, sets it open (separates it from
      its surrounding words by using spaces) when it is being used parenthetically.</p>
